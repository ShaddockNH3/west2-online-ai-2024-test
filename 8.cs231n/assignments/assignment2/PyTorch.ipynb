As a simple example, we provide a `flatten` function below which reshapes image data for use in a fully-connected neural network.\n","\n","Recall that image data is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x C x H x W, where:\n","\n","* N is the number of datapoints\n","* C is the number of channels\n","* H is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n","* W is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n","\n","This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).\n","\n","### PyTorch 张量：Flatten 函数\n","PyTorch 张量在概念上类似于 numpy 数组：它是一个 n 维数字网格，与 numpy 一样，PyTorch 提供了许多函数来高效地操作张量。作为一个简单的例子，我们在下面提供了一个 `flatten` 函数，该函数可以重塑图像数据以用于全连接神经网络。\n","\n","回想一下，图像数据通常存储在形状为 N x C x H x W 的张量中，其中：\n","\n","* N 是数据点的数量\n","* C 是通道数\n","* H 是中间特征图的高度（以像素为单位）\n","* W 是中间特征图的高度（以像素为单位）\n","\n","当我们进行类似 2D 卷积的操作时，这是表示数据的正确方法，这需要对中间特征相对于彼此的位置进行空间理解。然而，当我们使用完全连接的仿射层来处理图像时，我们希望每个数据点都由一个向量表示——将数据的不同通道、行和列分开不再有用。因此，我们使用“扁平化”操作将每个表示的“C x H x W”值折叠成一个长向量。下面的扁平化函数首先从给定的一批数据中读取 N、C、H 和 W 值，然后返回该数据的“视图”。 “视图”类似于 numpy 的“重塑”方法：它将 x 的维度重塑为 N x ??，其中 ?? 可以是任何值（在本例中，它将是 C x H x W，但我们不需要明确指定）。"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"id":"54ee9208","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore-input"],"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"54ee9208","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743084846196,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":61,"user":{"displayName":"Shaddock","userId":"09354626405321803709"}},"outputId":"6c2feec7-4c5c-4db8-eab3-8d510e17c6f4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Before flattening:  tensor([[[[ 0,  1],\n","          [ 2,  3],\n","          [ 4,  5]]],\n","\n","\n","        [[[ 6,  7],\n","          [ 8,  9],\n","          [10, 11]]]])\n","After flattening:  tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],\n","        [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]])\n"]}],"source":["def flatten(x):\n","    N = x.shape[0] # read in N, C, H, W\n","    return x.view(N, -1)  # \"flatten\" the C * H * W values into a single vector per image\n","\n","def test_flatten():\n","    x = torch.arange(12).view(2, 1, 3, 2)\n","    print('Before flattening: ', x)\n","    print('After flattening: ', flatten(x))\n","\n","def my_test_flatten1():\n","  x = torch.arange(60).view(10, 1, 3, 2)\n","  print('Before flattening: ', x)\n","  print('After flattening: ', flatten(x))\n","\n","test_flatten()\n","\n","# 简单来说，flatten就是按第一个维度展开为二维的"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8d8b0aff","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore"],"id":"8d8b0aff"},"source":["### Barebones PyTorch: Two-Layer Network\n","\n","Here we define a function `two_layer_fc` which performs the forward pass of a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network on a batch of image data.

This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n","\n","PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n","\n","To use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n","\n","1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`.\n","\n","2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n","\n","3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`!
