<blockquote><p><strong>Important submission note:</strong> For full credit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submit with Phase 1 complete by <strong>Tuesday, Feb 7</strong>, worth 1 pt.</li>
  <li>Submit the complete project by <strong>Friday, Feb 10</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to attempt the problems in order, as some later problems will depend on
earlier problems in their implementation and therefore also when running <code>ok</code>
tests.</p>

<p>You may complete the project with a partner.</p>

<p>You can get 1 bonus point by submitting the entire project by <strong>Thursday, Feb 9</strong>
You can receive extensions on the project deadline and checkpoint
deadline, but not on the early deadline, unless you're a DSP student with an
accommodation for assignment extensions.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the
dice game Hog. You will need to use <em>control statements</em> and <em>higher-order
functions</em> together, as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.6 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com">Composing
Programs</a>, the online textbook.</p>

<blockquote><p>When students in the past have tried to implement the functions without
thoroughly reading the problem description, they’ve often run into issues.
😱
<strong>Read each description thoroughly before starting to code.</strong></p></blockquote>


<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>


<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with
at least <code>GOAL</code> total points, where <code>GOAL</code> defaults to 100. On each turn, the current player chooses some number
of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the
dice outcomes. However, a player who rolls too many dice risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sow Sad</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>


        <button id='toggle-1' class='btn btn-outline btn-lg alwaystoggle toggle'>
        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-1">

<ul>
  <li><em>Example 1:</em> The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
  score <code>1</code> point for the turn.</li>
  <li><em>Example 2:</em> The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
  Sow Sad did not occur, they score <code>12</code> points for the turn.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>In a normal game of Hog, those are all the rules. To spice up the game, we'll
include some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pig Tail</strong>. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores
  <code>2 * abs(tens &#x2d; ones) + 1</code> points; where <code>tens</code>, <code>ones</code> are the
  tens and ones digits of the opponent's score. The ones digit refers to the
  rightmost digit and the tens digit refers to the second-rightmost digit.</li>
</ul>


        <button id='toggle-2' class='btn btn-outline btn-lg alwaystoggle toggle'>
        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-2">

<ul>
  <li><p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The opponent has <code>46</code> points, and the current player chooses to roll
    zero dice. <code>2 * abs(4 &#x2d; 6) + 1 = 5</code>, so the player gains <code>5</code> points.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The opponent has <code>73</code> points, and the current player chooses to roll
    zero dice. <code>2 * abs(7 &#x2d; 3) + 1 = 9</code>.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Square Swine</strong>. After a player gains points for their turn, if the
  resulting score is a perfect square, then increase their score to the next
  higher perfect square. A perfect square is any integer <code>n</code> where <code>n = d * d</code> for some integer <code>d</code>.</li>
</ul>

  <ul>
    <li>A player has 12 points and rolls 3 dice that total 13 points. Their
    	new score would be 25, but since 25 is 5 squared, their score is
    	increased to 6 squared: 36.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>A player has 12 points and rolls 3 dice that total 12 point. Their new
    score would be 24, which is not a perfect square.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><em>Example 3:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>A player has 0 points and rolls 5 dice, but one is a 1, so their new

    	increased to 4.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><em>Example 4:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>A player has 80 points and rolls 10 dice, but three are 1's, so their

<h2 id="download-starter-files">Download starter files</h2>


<p>To get started, download all of the project code as a <a href="hog/hog.zip">zip archive</a>.
Below is a list of all the files you will see in the archive once unzipped.
For the project, you'll only be making changes to <code>hog.py</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code>: A starter implementation of Hog</li>
  <li><code>dice.py</code>: Functions for making and rolling dice</li>
  <li><code>hog_gui.py</code>: A graphical user interface (GUI) for Hog (updated)</li>
  <li><code>ucb.py</code>: Utility functions for CS 61A</li>
  <li><code>hog_ui.py</code>: A text-based user interface (UI) for Hog</li>
  <li><code>ok</code>: CS 61A autograder</li>
  <li><code>tests</code>: A directory of tests used by <code>ok</code></li>
  <li><code>gui_files</code>: A directory of various things used by the web GUI</li>
</ul>

<p>You may notice some files other than the ones listed above too—those are needed for making the autograder and portions of the GUI work. Please do not modify any files other than <code>hog.py</code>.</p>




<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>



<!-- <p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
  project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p> -->



<p>The project is worth 25 points, of which 1 point is for submitting
Phase 1 by the checkpoint date of Tuesday, Feb 7.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, <b> submit the required files to the appropriate Gradescope assignment.</b></p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p><b>However, please do not modify any other functions or edit any files not
listed above</b>. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests.
Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or
number of arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations.</p>

<!-- <p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: The Game of Hog
Ok, version ...
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>  -->

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<!-- <p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. <b>If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission. </b></p>
-->

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<!--- <p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p> -->

<!---
<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, you can run

<pre>python3 ok --local</pre>


With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

-->

If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre> python3 ok -q [question number] -i </pre>

with the appropriate question number (e.g. <code>01</code>) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.</p>

<p>You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

<pre> print("DEBUG:", x) </pre>

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.

<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>

<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you. At the moment, it doesn't work because you haven't implemented the game logic. Once you complete the play function, you will be able to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<h2 id="phase-1-rules-of-the-game">Phase 1: Rules of the Game</h2>


<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>dice.py</code> file represents dice using non-pure zero-argument functions.
These functions are non-pure because they may have different return values each
time they are called, and so a side-effect of calling the function may be
changing what will happen when the function is called again. The documentation
of <code>dice.py</code> describes the two different types of dice used in the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fair</strong> dice produce each possible outcome with equal probability.  The
  <code>four_sided</code> and <code>six_sided</code> functions are examples.</li>
  <li><strong>Test</strong> dice are deterministic: they always cycle through a fixed sequence
  of values that are passed as arguments.  Test dice are generated by  the
  <code>make_test_dice</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before writing any code, read over the <code>dice.py</code> file and check your
understanding by unlocking the following tests.</p>

<pre style="margin-bottom:0;"><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q 00 -u<button id="copy-code-python3ok-q00-u" class="inline-copy-button"><div class="copy-tooltip"><span>Copy</span></div>✂️</a></code></pre>
        <script>
        document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-q00-u").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q 00 -u', "copy-code-python3ok-q00-u");
        </script>

<h3 id="problem-1-2-pt">Problem 1 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code>. It takes two arguments: a
positive integer called <code>num_rolls</code> giving the number of dice to roll and a
<code>dice</code> function. It returns the number of points scored by rolling the dice
that number of times in a turn: either the sum of the outcomes or 1 <em>(Sow
Sad)</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sow Sad</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is <code>1</code>.</li>
</ul>

        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-4">

<ul>
  <li><em>Example 1:</em> The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
  score <code>1</code> point for the turn.</li>
  <li><em>Example 2:</em> The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
  Sow Sad did not occur, they score <code>12</code> points for the turn.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call <code>dice()</code>. You should call
<code>dice()</code> <strong>exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times</strong> in the body of <code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>Remember to call <code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times <strong>even if Sow Sad happens
in the middle of rolling</strong>.  By doing so, you will correctly simulate rolling
all the dice together (and the user interface will work correctly).</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>roll_dice</code> function, and many other functions throughout the
project, makes use of <em>default argument values</em>—you can see this in the
function heading:</p>

<pre><code>def roll_dice(num_rolls, dice=six_sided): ...</code></pre>

<p>The argument <code>dice=six_sided</code> means that when <code>roll_dice</code> is called, the
<code>dice</code> argument is <strong>optional</strong>. If no value for <code>dice</code> is provided, then
<code>six_sided</code> is used by default.</p>

<p>For example, calling <code>roll_dice(3, four_sided)</code>, or equivalently <code>roll_dice(3,
dice=four_sided)</code>, simulates rolling 3 four-sided dice, while calling <code>roll_dice(3)</code>
simulates rolling 3 six-sided dice.</p></blockquote>

<h4 id="debugging-tips">Debugging Tips</h4>


<p>If the tests don't pass, it's time to debug. You can observe the behavior of
your function using Python directly. First, start the Python interpreter and
load the <code>hog.py</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>python3 &#x2d;i hog.py</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can call your <code>roll_dice</code> function on any number of dice you want.
The <code>roll_dice</code> function has a <a href="hog.html">default argument value</a> for <code>dice</code> that is a
random six-sided dice function. Therefore, the following call to <code>roll_dice</code>
simulates rolling four fair six-sided dice.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; roll_dice(4)</code></pre>

<p>You will find that the previous expression may have a different result each
time you call it, since it is simulating random dice rolls. You can also use
test dice that fix the outcomes of the dice in advance. For example, rolling
twice when you know that the dice will come up 3 and 4 should give a total
outcome of 7.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fixed_dice = make_test_dice(3, 4) roll_dice(2, fixed_dice)
7</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>On most systems, you can evaluate the same expression again by pressing the
up arrow, then pressing enter or return. To evaluate earlier commands, press
the up arrow repeatedly.</p>

<p>If you find a problem, you first need to change your <code>hog.py</code> file to fix the
problem, and save the file. Then, to check whether your fix works, you'll
have to quit the Python interpreter by either using <code>exit()</code> or <code>Ctrl^D</code>, and
re-run the interpreter to test the changes you made. Pressing the up arrow in
both the terminal and the Python interpreter should give you access to your
previous expressions, even after restarting Python.</p></blockquote>

<p>[default argument value]:
http://composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#default-argument-values</p>

<blockquote><p>Continue debugging your code and running the <code>ok</code> tests until they all pass.</p>

<p>One more debugging tip: to start the interactive interpreter automatically
upon failing an <code>ok</code> test, use <code>&#x2d;i</code>. For example, <code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 01 &#x2d;i</code> will
run the tests for question 1, then start an interactive interpreter with
<code>hog.py</code> loaded if a test fails.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="problem-5-5-pt">Problem 5 (5 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of Hog. Players take
turns rolling dice until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code> score, and the
final scores of both players are returned by the function.</p>

<p>To determine how many dice are rolled each turn, call the current player's
strategy function (Player 0 uses <code>strategy0</code> and Player 1 uses <code>strategy1</code>). A
<em>strategy</em> is a function that, given a player's score and their opponent's
score, returns the number of dice that the current player will roll in the
turn. An example strategy is <code>always_roll_5</code> which appears above <code>play</code>.</p>

<p>To determine the updated score for a player after they take a turn, call the
<code>update</code> function. An <code>update</code> function takes the number
of dice to roll, the current player's score, the opponent's score, and the
dice function used to simulate rolling dice. It returns the updated score
of the current player after they take their turn. Two examples of <code>update</code> functions
are <code>simple_update</code> and<code>square_update</code>.</p>

<p>If a player achieves the goal score by the end of their turn, i.e. after all
applicable rules have been applied, the game ends. <code>play</code> will then return the
final total scores of both players, with Player 0's score first and Player 1's
score second.</p>

<p>Some example calls to <code>play</code> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>play(always_roll_5, always_roll_5, simple_update)</code> simulates two players
  that both always roll 5 dice each turn, playing with just the Sow Sad and Pig
  Tail rules.</li>
  <li><code>play(always_roll_5, always_roll_5, square_update)</code> simulates two players
  that both always roll 5 dice each turn, playing with the Square Swine rule in
  addition to the Sow Sad and Pig Tail rules (i.e. all the rules).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> For the user interface to work, a strategy function should be
called only once per turn.  Only call <code>strategy0</code> when it is Player 0's turn
and only call <code>strategy1</code> when it is Player 1's turn.</p>

<p><strong>Hints</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If <code>who</code> is the current player, the next player is <code>1 &#x2d; who</code>.</li>
  <li>To call <code>play(always_roll_5, always_roll_5, square_update)</code> and print out
  what happens each turn, run <code>python3 hog_ui.py</code> from the terminal.</li>

<h3 id="printing-game-events">Printing Game Events</h3>


<p>We have built a simulator for the game, but haven't added any code to describe
how the game events should be displayed to a person. Therefore, we've built a
computer game that no one can play. (Lame!)</p>

<p>However, the simulator is expressed in terms of small functions, and we can
replace each function by a version that prints out what happens when it is
called. Using higher-order functions, we can do so without changing much of our
original code.  An example appears in <code>hog_ui.py</code>, which you are encouraged to
read.</p>

<p>The <code>play_and_print</code> function calls the same <code>play</code> function just implemented,
but using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>new strategy functions (e.g., <code>printing_strategy(0, always_roll_5)</code>) that
  print out the scores and number of dice rolled.</li>
  <li>a new update function (<code>square_update_and_print</code>) that prints the outcome of
  each turn.</li>
  <li>a new dice function (<code>printing_dice(six_sided)</code>) that prints the outcome of
  rolling the dice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice how much of the original simulator code can be reused.</p>

<p>Running <code>python3 hog_ui.py</code> from the terminal calls
<code>play_and_print(always_roll_5, always_roll_5)</code>.</p>


<h3 id="accepting-user-input">Accepting User Input</h3>


<p>The built-in <code>input</code> function waits for the user to type a line of text and
then returns that text as a string. The built-in <code>int</code> function can take a
string containing the digits of an integer and return that integer.</p>

<p>The <code>interactive_strategy</code> function returns a strategy that let's a person
choose how many dice to roll each turn by calling <code>input</code>.</p>

<p>With this strategy, we can finally play a game using our <code>play</code> function:</p>

<p>Running <code>python3 hog_ui.py &#x2d;n 1</code> from the terminal calls
<code>play_and_print(interactive_strategy(0), always_roll_5)</code>, which plays a game
betweem a human (Player 0) and a computer strategy that always rolls 5.</p>

<p>Running <code>python3 hog_ui.py &#x2d;n 2</code> from the terminal calls
<code>play_and_print(interactive_strategy(0), interactive_strategy(1))</code>, which plays
a game between two human players.</p>

<p>You are welcome to change <code>hog_ui.py</code> in any way you want, for example to use
different strategies than <code>always_roll_5</code>.</p>


<h3 id="graphical-user-interface-gui">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>


<p>We have also provided a web-based graphical user interface for the game using a similar approach as <code>hog_ui.py</code> called <code>hog_gui.py</code>. You can run it from the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>Like <code>hog_ui.py</code>, the GUI relies on your simulator implementation, so if you have any bugs in your code, they will be reflected in the GUI. This means you can also use the GUI as a debugging tool; however, it's better to run the tests first.</p>

<p>The source code for the Hog GUI is <a href="https://github.com/Cal-CS-61A-Staff/cs61a-apps/tree/master/hog">publicly available on Github</a> but involves several other programming languages: Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

<br>


<h2 id="phase-2-strategies">Phase 2: Strategies</h2>


<p>In this phase, you will experiment with ways to improve upon the basic
strategy of always rolling five dice. A <em>strategy</em> is a function that
takes two arguments: the current player's score and their opponent's score. It
returns the number of dice the player will roll, which can be from 0 to 10
(inclusive).</p>


<h3 id="problem-6-2-pt">Problem 6 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>always_roll</code>, a higher-order function that takes a number of dice
<code>n</code> and returns a strategy that always rolls <code>n</code> dice. Thus, <code>always_roll(5)</code>
would be equivalent to <code>always_roll_5</code>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-8-2-pt">Problem 8 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>make_averaged</code>, which is a higher-order function that
takes a function <code>original_function</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>The return value of <code>make_averaged</code> is a function that takes in the same
number of arguments as <code>original_function</code>. When we call this returned function
on the arguments, it will return the average value of repeatedly calling
<code>original_function</code> on the arguments passed in.</p>

<p>Specifically, this function should call <code>original_function</code> a total of
<code>total_samples</code> times and return the average of the results of these calls.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong>
To implement this function, you will need to use a new piece of Python syntax.
We would like to write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
and then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, you can write <code>*args</code>,
which represents all of the <strong>arg</strong>ument<strong>s</strong> that get passed into the
function. We can then call another function with these same arguments by
passing these <code>*args</code> into this other function. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def printed(f):
...     def print_and_return(*args):
...         result = f(*args)
...         print(&#x27;Result:&#x27;, result)
...         return result
...     return print_and_return
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow = printed(pow)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_pow(2, 8)
Result: 256
256
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs = printed(abs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; printed_abs(&#x2d;10)
Result: 10
10</code></pre>

<p>Here, we can pass any number of arguments into <code>print_and_return</code> via the
<code>*args</code> syntax. We can also use <code>*args</code> inside our <code>print_and_return</code>
function to make another function call with the same arguments.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="problem-9-2-pt">Problem 9 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code>, which runs an experiment to
determine the number of rolls (from 1 to 10) that gives the maximum average
score for a turn. Your implementation should use <code>make_averaged</code> and
<code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>If two numbers of rolls are tied for the maximum average score, return the
lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a maximum average score,
return 3.</p>

<p>You might find it useful to read the doctest and the example shown in the doctest
for this problem before doing the unlocking test.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important:</strong> In order to pass all of our tests, please make sure that you are
testing dice rolls starting from 1 going up to 10, rather than from 10 to 1.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="running-experiments">Running Experiments</h3>


<p>The provided <code>run_experiments</code> function calls
<code>max_scoring_num_rolls(six_sided)</code> and prints the result. You will likely find
that rolling 6 dice maximizes the result of <code>roll_dice</code> using six-sided dice.</p>

<p>To call this function and see the result, run <code>hog.py</code> with the <code>&#x2d;r</code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>python3 hog.py &#x2d;r</code></pre>

<p>In addition, <code>run_experiments</code> compares various strategies to <code>always_roll(6)</code>.
You are welcome to change the implementation of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.
Note that running experiments with <code>tail_strategy</code> and <code>square_strategy</code> will not
have accurate results until you implement them in the next two problems.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of trials in your call to <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>

<p>Running experiments won't affect your score on the project.</p>

<h3 id="problem-10-2-pt">Problem 10 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can try to take advantage of the <em>Pig Tail</em> rule by rolling 0 when
it is most beneficial to do so. Implement <code>tail_strategy</code>, which returns 0
whenever rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>threshold</code> points and returns
<code>num_rolls</code> otherwise. This strategy should <strong>not</strong> also take into account
the Square Swine rule.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint</strong>: You can use the <code>tail_points</code> function you defined in Problem 2.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="problem-11-2-pt">Problem 11 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>A better strategy will take advantage of both <em>Pig Tail</em> and <em>Square Swine</em> in
combination. Even a small number of pig tail points can lead to large gains.
For example, if a player has 31 points and their opponent has 42, rolling 0
would bring them to 36 which is a perfect square, and so they would end the
turn with 49 points: a gain of 49 - 31 = 18!</p>

<p>The <code>square_strategy</code> returns 0 whenever rolling 0 would result in a score that
is <strong>at least</strong> <code>threshold</code> points more than the player's score at the
start of turn.</p>

<p>Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines these ideas and any other ideas you
have to achieve a high win rate against the baseline strategy. Some
suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you know the goal score (by default it is 100), there's no benefit to
  scoring more than the goal. Check whether you can win by rolling 0, 1 or 2
  dice. If you are in the lead, you might decide to take fewer risks.</li>
  <li>Instead of using a threshold, roll 0 whenever it would give you more points
  on average than rolling 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check that your final strategy is valid by running <code>ok</code>.</p>
