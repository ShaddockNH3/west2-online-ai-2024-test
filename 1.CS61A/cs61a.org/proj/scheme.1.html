<p>In this project, you will develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme
language. As you proceed, think about the issues that arise in the design of a
programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation
decisions in interpreters and compilers. The subset of the language used in this
project is described in the <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/32-functional-programming.html">functional programming</a> section of Composing
Programs, as well as this <a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html">language specification</a> and
<a href="../articles/scheme-builtins/index.html">built-in procedure reference</a>.</p>

<p>Watch the lecture on Interpreters for an overview of
the project.</p>

<p>In addition, there will be a completely optional open-ended art contest
(released separately) that challenges you to produce recursive images in only a
few lines of Scheme. As an example, the picture above abstractly depicts all the
ways of making change for $0.50 using U.S. currency. All flowers appear at the
end of a branch with length 50. Small angles in a branch indicate an additional
coin, while large angles indicate a new currency denomination. In the contest,
you too will have the chance to unleash your inner recursive artist.</p>

<!-- For this project, we are releasing an alternative challenge version of the project, which
provides much less guidance in the project specification as well as a minimal
amount of starter code. It is appropriate for students with a substantial amount
of coding experience who want a rather challenging project. It will be
worth no more points than the standard version, but can be completed instead of
the standard version for full credit. -->

<!-- <p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
  project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p> -->



<p>The project is worth 30 points.
28 points are for correctness,
which is including 1 point for passing <code>tests.scm</code>.
1 point is for submitting Part 1 by the first checkpoint date,
and 1 point is for submitting Parts 2 &amp; 3 by the second checkpoint date.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code></li>
  <li><code>scheme_forms.py</code></li>
  <li><code>scheme_classes.py</code></li>
  <li><code>questions.scm</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, <b> submit the required files to the appropriate Gradescope assignment.</b></p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p><b>However, please do not modify any other functions or edit any files not
listed above</b>. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests.
Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or
number of arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations.</p>

<!-- <p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================================
Assignment: Scheme Interpreter
Ok, version ...
=====================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unlocking tests

At each "? ", type what you would expect the output to be.
Type exit() to quit

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>  -->

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<!-- <p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue. <b>If you forget to submit, your last backup will be automatically converted to a submission. </b></p>
-->

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<!--- <p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="scheme.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p> -->

<!---
<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, you can run

<pre>python3 ok --local</pre>


With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

-->

If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre> python3 ok -q [question number] -i </pre>

with the appropriate question number (e.g. <code>01</code>) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.</p>

<p>You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by writing

<pre> print("DEBUG:", x) </pre>

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.

<h2 id="interpreter-details">Interpreter details</h2>



<h3 id="scheme-features">Scheme features</h3>


<p><strong>Read-Eval-Print.</strong> The interpreter reads Scheme expressions, evaluates them,
and displays the results.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; 2
2
scm&gt; (+ 2 3)
5
scm&gt; ((lambda (x) (* x x)) 5)
25</code></pre>



<p>The starter code for your Scheme interpreter can successfully
evaluate the first expression above, since it consists of a single number. The
second (a call to a built-in procedure) and the third (a computation of 5
squared) will not work just yet.</p>

<p><strong>Load.</strong> You can load a file by passing in a symbol for the file name.
For example, to load <code>tests.scm</code>, evaluate the following call expression.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (load &#x27;tests)</code></pre>



<p><strong>Symbols.</strong> Various dialects of Scheme are more or less permissive
about identifiers (which serve as symbols and variable names).</p>

<p>Our rule is that:</p>

<blockquote><p>An identifier is a sequence of letters (a-z and A-Z), digits, and characters
in <code>!$%&amp;*/:&lt;=&gt;?@^_~&#x2d;+.</code> that do not form a valid integer or floating-point
numeral and are not existing special form shorthands.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our version of Scheme is case-insensitive: two identifiers are considered
identical if they differ only in the capitalization of letters.
They are internally represented and printed in lower case:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; &#x27;Hello
hello</code></pre>



<p><strong>Turtle Graphics.</strong> In addition to standard Scheme procedures, we include
procedure calls to the Python <code>turtle</code> package. This will come in handy
for the contest. You <strong>do not</strong> have to install this package in order to participate.</p>

<p>If you're curious, you can read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/turtle.html">turtle module
documentation</a> online.</p>

<!-- ### Implementation overview

Here is a brief overview of each of the Read-Eval-Print Loop components in our
interpreter. Refer to this section as you work through the project as a reminder of how all the small pieces fit together!

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Read</strong>: This step parses user input (a string of Scheme code) into our
  interpreter's internal Python representation of Scheme expressions (e.g. Pairs).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Lexical analysis</em> has already been implemented for you in the
    <code>tokenize_lines</code> function in <code>scheme_tokens.py</code>. This function returns a
    <code>Buffer</code> (from <code>buffer.py</code>) of tokens. You do not need to fully
    understand the code for this step.</li>
    <li><em>Syntactic analysis</em> happens in <code>scheme_reader.py</code>, in the <code>scheme_read</code>
    and <code>read_tail</code> functions. Together, these mutually recursive functions
    parse Scheme tokens into our interpreter's internal Python representation
    of Scheme expressions. You will complete both functions in Lab 11. For the
    project, you will use our staff solution.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><strong>Eval</strong>: This step evaluates Scheme expressions (represented in Python) to
  obtain values. Code for this step is in the main <code>scheme.py</code> file.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Eval</em> happens in the <code>scheme_eval</code> function. If the expression is a call expression, it gets evaluated according to the rules for evaluating call expressions
    (you will implement this). If the expression being evaluated is a special form, the corresponding <code>do_?_form</code> function is
    called. You will complete several of the <code>do_?_form</code> functions, such as <code>do_define_form</code>, <code>do_lambda_form</code>, etc...</li>
    <li><em>Apply</em> happens in the <code>scheme_apply</code> function. If the procedure is a user-defined procedure, <code>scheme_apply</code> creates a new call frame and
    calls <code>eval_all</code> on the body of the procedure, resulting in a mutually recursive eval-apply loop.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Print</strong>: This step prints the <code>__str__</code> representation of the obtained
  value.</li>
  <li><strong>Loop</strong>: The logic for the loop is handled by the <code>read_eval_print_loop</code> function in <code>scheme.py</code>. You do not need to understand the entire implementation.</li>
</ul>

**Exceptions.** As you develop your Scheme interpreter, you may find that
Python raises various uncaught exceptions when evaluating Scheme expressions.
As a result, your Scheme interpreter will halt. Some of these may be the
results of bugs in your program, but some might just be errors in user
programs. The former should be fixed by debugging your interpreter
and the latter should be handled by your code, usually by raising a <code>SchemeError</code>. All
<code>SchemeError</code> exceptions are handled and printed as error messages by the
<code>read_eval_print_loop</code> function in <code>scheme.py</code>. Ideally, there should *never*
be unhandled Python exceptions for any input to your interpreter. -->


<h3 id="running-the-interpreter">Running the interpreter</h3>


<p>To start an interactive Scheme interpreter session, type:</p>

<pre><code>python3 scheme.py</code></pre>

<p>To exit the Scheme interpreter, press <code>Ctrl&#x2d;d</code> on Mac/Linux (or <code>Ctrl&#x2d;z Enter</code> on Windows) or evaluate the <code>exit</code> procedure
(after completing problems 3 and 4):</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (exit)</code></pre>



<p>You can use your Scheme interpreter to evaluate the expressions in an input file
by passing the file name as a command-line argument to <code>scheme.py</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 scheme.py tests.scm</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tests.scm</code> file contains a long list of sample Scheme expressions and
their expected values. Many of these examples are from Chapters 1 and 2 of
<a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, the textbook from

<h2 id="part-1-the-evaluator">Part 1: The Evaluator</h2>


<p>In Part 1, you will develop the following features of the interpreter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Symbol evaluation</li>
  <li>Calling built-in procedures</li>
  <li>Definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>In the starter implementation given to you, the interpreter can only evaluate
self-evaluating expressions: numbers, booleans, and <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>First, read the relevant code.  In the "Eval/Apply" section of
<code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>scheme_eval</code> evaluates a Scheme expression in the given environment. This
  function is nearly complete but is missing the logic for call expressions.</li>
  <li>When evaluating a special form, <code>scheme_eval</code> redirects evaluation to an
  appropriate <code>do_?_form</code> function found in <code>scheme_forms.py</code></li>
  <li><code>scheme_apply</code> applies a procedure to some arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the "Environments" and "Procedures" section of <code>scheme_classes.py</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>Frame</code> class implements an environment frame.</li>
  <li>The <code>LambdaProcedure</code> class (in the "Procedures" section) represents
  user-defined procedures.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all of the essential components of the interpreter. <code>scheme_forms.py</code> defines special forms,
<code>scheme_builtins.py</code> defines the various functions built into the standard library,  and <code>scheme.py</code> defines the user interface to the interpreter.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> As all non-atomic Scheme expressions (i.e. call expressions and special forms) are Scheme lists (and therefore linked lists), we represent all non-atomic Scheme expressions using the <code>Pair</code> class, which behaves linke a linked list. For example, the expression <code>(+ 1 2)</code> will be represented in our interpreter as <code>Pair(&#x27;+&#x27;, Pair(1, Pair(2, nil)))</code>.
<strong>This class is defined in <code>pair.py</code>.</strong> Please take a look at this class before starting the project!</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="problem-1-1-pt">Problem 1 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>define</code> and <code>lookup</code> methods of the <code>Frame</code> class in <code>scheme_classes.py</code>.
Each <code>Frame</code> object has the following instance attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>bindings</code> is a dictionary representing the bindings in the frame. Each item
  associates a Scheme symbol (represented as a Python string) to a Scheme
  value.</li>
  <li><code>parent</code> is the parent <code>Frame</code> instance. The parent of the Global Frame is
  <code>None</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <code>scheme_classes.py</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>define</code> takes a symbol (represented by a Python string) and a value. It
  binds the symbol to the value in the <code>Frame</code> instance.</li>
  <li><p><code>lookup</code> takes a symbol and returns the value bound to that symbol in the
  first frame of the environment in which the symbol is bound. The
  <em>environment</em> for a <code>Frame</code> instance consists of that frame, its parent
  frame, and all its ancestor frames, including the Global Frame. When looking
  up a symbol:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the symbol is bound in the current frame, return its value.</li>
    <li>If the symbol is not bound in the current frame and the frame has a parent
    frame, look up the symbol in the parent frame.</li>
    <li>If the symbol is not found in the current frame and there is no parent frame,
    raise a <code>SchemeError</code>.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

        </script>
        <br/>

<p>After you complete this problem, you can start your Scheme interpreter
(with <code>python3 scheme.py</code>). You should be able to look up built-in
procedure names:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; +
#[+]
scm&gt; odd?
#[odd?]</code></pre>



<p>However, your Scheme interpreter will still not be able to call these
procedures. Let's fix that.</p>

<p>Remember, at this point you can only exit the interpreter by pressing <code>Ctrl&#x2d;d</code> on Max/Linux (or <code>Ctrl&#x2d;z Enter</code> on Windows).</p>


<h3 id="problem-2-2-pt">Problem 2 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>To be able to call built-in procedures, such as <code>+</code>, you need to complete the
<code>BuiltinProcedure</code> case within the <code>scheme_apply</code> function in
<code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>. Built-in procedures are applied by calling a
corresponding Python function that implements the procedure.</p>

<blockquote><p>To see a list of all Scheme built-in procedures used in the project, look in
the <code>scheme_builtins.py</code> file. Any function decorated with <code>@builtin</code>
will be added to the globally-defined <code>BUILTINS</code> list.</p></blockquote>

<p>A <code>BuiltinProcedure</code> has two instance attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>py_func</code>: the <em>Python</em> function that implements the built-in Scheme procedure.</li>
  <li><code>need_env</code>: a Boolean flag that indicates whether or not this built-in
  procedure will need the current environment to be passed in as the last
  argument. The environment is required, for instance, to implement the built-in
  <code>eval</code> procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>scheme_apply</code> takes the <code>procedure</code> object, a list of argument values, and
the current environment. <code>args</code> is a Scheme list represented as a
<code>Pair</code> object or <code>nil</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Your implementation should do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert the Scheme list to a Python list of arguments. <em>Hint:</em> <code>args</code> is a
  <code>Pair</code>, which has a <code>.first</code> and <code>.rest</code> attribute.</li>
  <li>If <code>procedure.need_env</code> is <code>True</code>, then add the current environment <code>env</code>
  as the last argument to this Python list.</li>
  <li>Return the result of calling <code>procedure.py_func</code> on all of those arguments. Use <code>*args</code> notation: <code>f(1, 2, 3)</code> is equivalent to <code>f(*[1, 2, 3]</code>). Do this part within the <code>try</code> statement provided, after the line that says <code>try:</code>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>We have already implemented the following behavior for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If calling the function results in a <code>TypeError</code> exception being raised, then
  the wrong number of arguments were passed. The <code>try</code> statement
  handles this exception and raises a <code>SchemeError</code> with the message
  <code>&#x27;incorrect number of arguments&#x27;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-3-2-pt">Problem 3 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>scheme_eval</code> function (in <code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>) evaluates a Scheme
expression in an environment. The provided code
already looks up symbols in the current environment, returns self-evaluating
expressions (such as numbers), and evaluates special forms.</p>

<p>Implement the missing part of <code>scheme_eval</code>, which evaluates a call expression.
To evaluate a call expression:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Evaluate the operator (which should evaluate to a <code>Procedure</code> instance).</li>
  <li>Evaluate all of the operands and collect the results (the argument values) in a Scheme list.</li>
  <li>Return the result of calling <code>scheme_apply</code> on this <code>Procedure</code> and these argument values.</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll have to recursively call <code>scheme_eval</code> in the first two steps. Here are
some other functions/methods you should use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>map</code> method of <code>Pair</code> returns a new Scheme list constructed by applying a
  <em>one-argument function</em> to every item in a Scheme list.</li>
  <li>The <code>scheme_apply</code> function applies a Scheme procedure to arguments
  represented as a Scheme list (a <code>Pair</code> instance or <code>nil</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Important: do not mutate the passed-in <code>expr</code>. That would change a program as
it's being evaluated, creating strange and incorrect effects.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of these tests call a primitive (built-in) procedure called
<code>print&#x2d;then&#x2d;return</code>. This procedure doesn't exist in Scheme, but was added to
this project just to test this question. <code>print&#x2d;then&#x2d;return</code> takes two
arguments. It prints out its first argument and returns the second. You can
find this function at the bottom of <code>scheme_builtins.py</code></p></blockquote>

<p>Your interpreter should now be able to evaluate built-in procedure calls, giving
you the functionality of the Calculator language and more. Run <code>python3
scheme.py</code>, and you can now add and multiply!</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (+ 1 2)
3
scm&gt; (* 3 4 (&#x2d; 5 2) 1)
36
scm&gt; (odd? 31)

<h3 id="problem-4-2-pt">Problem 4 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>define</code> special form (<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#define">spec</a>) in Scheme can be used either to assign a symbol to the
value of a given expression or to create a procedure and bind it to a symbol:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define a (+ 2 3))  ; Binds the symbol a to the value of (+ 2 3)
a
scm&gt; (define (foo x) x)  ; Creates a procedure and binds it to the symbol foo
foo</code></pre>



<p>The type of the first operand tells us what is being defined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If it is a symbol, e.g. <code>a</code>, then the expression is defining a symbol.</li>
  <li>If it is a list, e.g. <code>(foo x)</code>, then the expression is creating a procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>do_define_form</code> function in <code>scheme_forms.py</code> evaluates <code>(define ...)</code>
expressions. There are two missing parts in this function. For this problem,
implement <strong>just the first part</strong>, which evaluates the second operand to obtain
a value and binds the first operand, a symbol, to that value. Then,
<code>do_define_form</code> returns the symbol that was bound.</p>

<p>Use Ok to unlock and test your code:</p><pre style="margin-bottom:0;"><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q 04 -u
python3 ok -q 04<button id="copy-code-python3ok-q04-upython3ok-q04" class="inline-copy-button"><div class="copy-tooltip"><span>Copy</span></div>✂️</a></code></pre>

        </script>
        <br/>

<p>You should now be able to assign values to symbols and evaluate those symbols.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define x 15)
x
scm&gt; (define y (* 2 x))
y
scm&gt; y
30</code></pre>



<p>The following <code>ok</code> test determines whether the operator of a call expression is
evaluated multiple times. The operator should be evaluated only a <em>single</em> time
before raising an error (because <code>x</code> is not bound to a procedure).</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(define x 0)
; expect x
((define x (+ x 1)) 2)
; expect SchemeError
x
; expect 1</code></pre>



<p>If the operator is evaluated twice, then <code>x</code> will be bound to 2 instead of 1 at
the end, causing the test to fail. Therefore, if your code fails this test,
you'll want to make sure you only evaluate the operator of a call expression
once in <code>scheme_eval</code>.</p>


<h3 id="problem-5-1-pt">Problem 5 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>In Scheme, you can quote expressions in two ways: with the <code>quote</code> special form
(<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#quote">spec</a>) or with the symbol <code>&#x27;</code>.  The reader converts <code>&#x27;...</code> into
<code>(quote ...)</code>, so that your interpreter only needs to evaluate the <code>(quote ...)</code>
syntax. The <code>quote</code> special form returns its operand expression without
evaluating it:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (quote hello)
hello
scm&gt; &#x27;(cons 1 2)  ; Equivalent to (quote (cons 1 2))
(cons 1 2)</code></pre>



<p>Implement the <code>do_quote_form</code> function in <code>scheme_forms.py</code> so that it simply
returns the unevaluated operand of the <code>(quote ...)</code> expression.</p>

        </script>
        <br/>

<p>After completing this function, you should be able to evaluate quoted
expressions. Try out some of the following in your interpreter!</p>

<p>Then, submit <code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>, <code>scheme_forms.py</code>, <code>scheme_classes.py</code>, and <code>questions.scm</code> to the <strong>Scheme Checkpoint 1</strong> assignment on <strong>Gradescope</strong> before the first checkpoint deadline.</p>

<p>When you run <code>ok</code> commands, you'll still see that some tests are locked

<h2 id="part-2-procedures">Part 2: Procedures</h2>


<p>In Part 2, you will add the ability to create and call user-defined procedures.
You will add the following features to the interpreter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lambda procedures, using the <code>(lambda ...)</code> special form</li>
  <li>Named procedures, using the <code>(define (...) ...)</code> special form</li>
  <li>Dynamically scoped mu procedures, using the <code>(mu ...)</code> special form.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="user-defined-procedures">User-Defined Procedures</h3>


<p>User-defined lambda procedures are represented as instances of the <code>LambdaProcedure</code>
class. A <code>LambdaProcedure</code> instance has three instance attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>formals</code> is a Scheme list of the formal parameters (symbols) that name the
  arguments of the procedure.</li>
  <li><code>body</code> is a Scheme list of expressions; the body of the procedure.</li>
  <li><code>env</code> is the environment in which the procedure was <strong>defined</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="problem-6-1-pt">Problem 6 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>Change the <code>eval_all</code> function in <code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code> (which is called from
<code>do_begin_form</code> in <code>scheme_forms.py</code>) to complete the implementation of the
<code>begin</code> special form (<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#begin">spec</a>).</p>

<p>A <code>begin</code> expression is evaluated by evaluating all sub-expressions in order.
The value of the <code>begin</code> expression is the value of the final sub-expression.</p>

<p>To complete the implementation of <code>begin</code>, <code>eval_all</code> will take in <code>expressions</code>
(a Scheme list of expressions) and <code>env</code> (a <code>Frame</code> representing the current
environment), evaluate all the expressions in <code>expressions</code>, and return the
value of the last expression in <code>expressions</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (begin (+ 2 3) (+ 5 6))

<p>If <code>eval_all</code> is passed an empty list of expressions (<code>nil</code>), then it should
return the Python value <code>None</code>, which represents the Scheme value <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Implement the <code>do_lambda_form</code> function (<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#lambda">spec</a>) in
<code>scheme_forms.py</code>, which creates and returns a <code>LambdaProcedure</code> instance.
While you cannot call a user-defined procedure yet, you can verify that you
have created the procedure correctly by evaluating a lambda expression.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (lambda (x y) (+ x y))
(lambda (x y) (+ x y))</code></pre>



<p>In Scheme, it is legal to place more than one expression in the body of a
procedure. (There must be at least one expression.) The <code>body</code> attribute of a
<code>LambdaProcedure</code> instance is therefore a Scheme list of body expressions. The
<code>formals</code> attribute of a <code>LambdaProcedure</code> instance should be a properly nested
<code>Pair</code> expression. Like a <code>begin</code> special form, evaluating the body of a
procedure evaluates all body expressions in order. The return value of a
procedure is the value of its last body expression.</p>

in <code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>.</p>

<p>You should first create a new <code>Frame</code> instance using the <code>make_child_frame</code>
method of the appropriate parent frame, binding formal parameters to argument
values. Then, evaluate each of the expressions of the body of the procedure
using <code>eval_all</code> within this new frame.</p>

<p>Your new frame should be a child of the frame in which the lambda is defined.
Note that the <code>env</code> provided as an argument to <code>scheme_apply</code> is instead the
frame in which the procedure is called.

<p>Currently, your Scheme interpreter is able to bind symbols to user-defined
procedures in the following manner:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define f (lambda (x) (* x 2)))
f</code></pre>



<p>However, we'd like to be able to use the shorthand form of defining named
procedures:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define (f x) (* x 2))
f</code></pre>



<p>Modify the <code>do_define_form</code> function in <code>scheme_forms.py</code> so that it correctly handles
<code>define (...) ...)</code> expressions (<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#define">spec</a>).</p>

<p>Make sure that it can handle multi-expression bodies. For example,</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define (g y) (print y) (+ y 1))
g
scm&gt; (g 3)
3
4</code></pre>



<p>There are (at least) two ways to solve this problem. One is to construct an expression <code>(define _ (lambda ...))</code> and call <code>do_define_form</code> on it (omitting the <code>define</code>).  The second is to implement it directly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using the given variables <code>signature</code> and <code>expressions</code>, find the defined
  function's name (symbol), formals, and body.</li>
  <li>Create a <code>LambdaProcedure</code> instance using the formals and body. (You could call <code>do_lambda_form</code> to do this.)</li>
  <li>Bind the symbol to this new <code>LambdaProcedure</code> instance.</li>
  <li>Return the symbol that was bound.</li>

<p>All of the Scheme procedures we've seen so far use <em>lexical scoping</em>: the parent
of the new call frame is the environment in which the procedure was <strong>defined</strong>.
Another type of scoping, which is not standard in Scheme but appears in other
variants of Lisp, is called <em>dynamic scoping</em>: the parent of the new call frame
is the environment in which the call expression was <strong>evaluated</strong>. With dynamic
scoping, calling the same procedure with the same arguments from different parts
of your code can create different behavior (due to different parent frames).</p>

<p>The <code>mu</code> special form (<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#mu">spec</a>; invented for this project) evaluates
to a dynamically scoped procedure.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define f (mu () (* a b)))
f
scm&gt; (define g (lambda () (define a 4) (define b 5) (f)))
g
scm&gt; (g)
20</code></pre>



<p>Above, the procedure <code>f</code> does not have <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> as arguments; however, because
<code>f</code> gets called <strong>within</strong> the procedure <code>g</code>, it has access to the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
defined in <code>g</code>'s frame.</p>

<p>Your job:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implement <code>do_mu_form</code> in <code>scheme_forms.py</code> to evaluate the <code>mu</code> special form.
  A <code>mu</code> expression  evaluates to a <code>MuProcedure</code>. The <code>MuProcedure</code> class
  (defined in <code>scheme_classes.py</code>) has been provided for you.</li>
  <li>In addition to implementing <code>do_mu_form</code>, complete the <code>MuProcedure</code> case
  within the <code>scheme_apply</code> function (in <code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>) so that when a
  mu procedure is called, its body is evaluated in the correct environment. When
  a <code>MuProcedure</code> is called, the parent of the new call frame is the environment
  in which that call expression was <strong>evaluated</strong>. As a result, a <code>MuProcedure</code>
  does not need to store an environment as an instance attribute.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Defining named procedures using <code>define</code> expressions, and</li>
  <li>Calling user-defined procedures.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="part-3-special-forms">Part 3: Special Forms</h2>


<p>This section will be completed in <code>scheme_forms.py</code>.</p>

<p>Logical special forms include <code>if</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>cond</code>. These expressions
are special because not all of their sub-expressions may be evaluated.</p>

<p>In Scheme, only <code>#f</code> is a false value. All other values
(including <code>0</code> and <code>nil</code>) are true values. You can test whether a value is a
true or false value using the provided Python functions <code>is_scheme_true</code> and
<code>is_scheme_false</code>, defined in <code>scheme_utils.py</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Scheme traditionally uses <code>#f</code> to indicate the false Boolean value. In our
interpreter, that is equivalent to <code>false</code> or <code>False</code>. Similarly, <code>true</code>,
<code>True</code>, and <code>#t</code> are all equivalent. However, <strong>when unlocking tests</strong>, use
<code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>To get you started, we've provided an implementation of the <code>if</code> special form in
the <code>do_if_form</code> function. Make sure you understand that implementation before
starting the following questions.</p>

<p>Implement <code>do_and_form</code> and <code>do_or_form</code> so that <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> expressions
(<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#and">spec</a>) are evaluated correctly.</p>

<p>The logical forms <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are <em>short-circuiting</em>. For <code>and</code>, your
interpreter should evaluate each sub-expression from left to right, and if any
of these is a false value, return that value. Otherwise,
return the value of the last sub-expression. If there are no
sub-expressions in an <code>and</code> expression, it evaluates to <code>#t</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Internal to the interpreter, represent Scheme's <code>#t</code> as Python's <code>True</code>

<p>For <code>or</code>, evaluate each sub-expression from left to right. If any
sub-expression evaluates to a true value, return that value. Otherwise, return
the value of the last sub-expression.
If there are no sub-expressions in an <code>or</code> expression,
it evaluates to <code>#f</code>.</p>

<p>Fill in the missing parts of <code>do_cond_form</code> so that it correctly implements
<code>cond</code> (<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#cond">spec</a>), returning the value of the first result
sub-expression corresponding to a true predicate, or the value of the result
sub-expression corresponding to <code>else</code>.</p>

<p>Some special cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the true predicate does not have a corresponding result sub-expression,
  return the predicate value.</li>
  <li>When a result sub-expression of a <code>cond</code> case has multiple expressions,
  evaluate them all and return the value of the last expression. (<em>Hint</em>: Use
  <code>eval_all</code>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your implementation should match the following examples and the additional tests
in <code>tests.scm</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (cond ((= 4 3) &#x27;nope)

<p>The <code>let</code> special form (<a href="../articles/scheme-spec/index.html#let">spec</a>) binds symbols to values locally,
giving them their initial values. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (define x 5)
x
scm&gt; (define y &#x27;bye)
y
scm&gt; (let ((x 42)

       (list x y))
(42 50)
scm&gt; (list x y)
(5 bye)</code></pre>



<p>Implement <code>make_let_frame</code> in <code>scheme_forms.py</code>, which returns a child
frame of <code>env</code> that binds the symbol in each element of <code>bindings</code> to the
value of its corresponding expression. The <code>bindings</code> Scheme list contains
pairs that each contain a symbol and a corresponding expression.</p>

<p>You may find the following functions and methods useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>validate_form</code>: this function can be used to validate the structure of each
  binding. It takes in a Scheme list <code>expr</code> of expressions and a <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
  length. If <code>expr</code> is not a list with length between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> inclusive,
  it raises an error. If no <code>max</code> is passed in, the default is infinity.</li>
  <li><code>validate_formals</code>: this function validates that its argument is a
  Scheme list of symbols for which each symbol is distinct.</li>
</ul>

<p>To run these tests (worth 1 point), run the command:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q tests.scm</code></pre>



<p>If you have passed all of the required cases,
you should see 1/1 points
received for <code>tests.scm</code> when you run <code>python ok &#x2d;&#x2d;score</code>.
If you are failing tests due to output from
<code>print</code> statements you've added in your code for debugging,
make sure to remove those as well for the tests to pass.</p>

<p><strong>Submit your Phase 2 &amp; 3 checkpoint</strong></p>

<p>Check to make sure that you completed all the problems in Phase 1:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;&#x2d;score</code></pre>

<p>Then, submit <code>scheme_eval_apply.py</code>, <code>scheme_forms.py</code>, <code>scheme_classes.py</code>, and <code>questions.scm</code> to the <strong>Scheme Checkpoint 2</strong> assignment on <strong>Gradescope</strong> before the second checkpoint deadline.</p>

<p>When you run <code>ok</code> commands, you'll still see that some tests are locked
because you haven't completed the whole project yet. You'll get full credit for
the checkpoint if you complete all the problems up to this point.</p>

<h2 id="optional-problems">Optional Problems</h2>



<h3 id="optional-problem-0-pt">Optional Problem (0 pt)</h3>


<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This problem assumes you are familiar with a concept known as <em>Programs As Data</em>, a topic that is out of scope for Spring 2023. If you would like to attempt this question, it may be helpful to take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgAH04zhEaU&list=PL6BsET-8jgYUPPT418Qj1Tt-vGwsw5TVo">Fall 2022 Programs As Data Lecture</a></p>

<p>In Scheme, source code is data. Every non-atomic expression is written as a Scheme list, so we can write procedures that manipulate other programs just as we write procedures that manipulate lists.</p>

<p>Rewriting programs can be useful: we can write an interpreter that only handles a small core of the language, and then write a procedure that converts other special forms into the core language before a program is passed to the interpreter.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>let</code> special form is equivalent to a call expression that begins with a <code>lambda</code> expression. Both create a new frame extending the current environment and evaluate a body within that new environment.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b))
;; Is equivalent to:
((lambda (a b) (+ a b)) 1 2)</code></pre>



<p>These expressions can be represented by the following diagrams:</p>



        <div class="table-responsive">
          <table class="table table-bordered">
          
  <tr>

<p>Use this rule to implement a procedure called <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> in <code>questions.scm</code> that rewrites all <code>let</code> special forms into <code>lambda</code> expressions. If we quote a <code>let</code> expression and pass it into this procedure, an equivalent <code>lambda</code> expression should be returned:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda &#x27;(let ((a 1) (b 2)) (+ a b)))
((lambda (a b) (+ a b)) 1 2)
scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda &#x27;(let ((a 1)) (let ((b a)) b)))
((lambda (a) ((lambda (b) b) a)) 1)
scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda 1)
1
scm&gt; (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda &#x27;a)
a</code></pre>



<p>In order to handle all programs, <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> must be aware of Scheme syntax. Since Scheme expressions are recursively nested, <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> must also be recursive. In fact, the structure of <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> is somewhat similar to that of <code>scheme_eval</code>—but in Scheme! As a reminder, atoms include numbers, booleans, <code>nil</code>, and symbols. You do not need to consider code that contains quasiquotation for this problem.</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(define (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda expr)
  (cond ((atom?   expr) &lt;rewrite atoms&gt;)
        ((quoted? expr) &lt;rewrite quoted expressions&gt;)
        ((lambda? expr) &lt;rewrite lambda expressions&gt;)
        ((define? expr) &lt;rewrite define expressions&gt;)
        ((let?    expr) &lt;rewrite let expressions&gt;)
        (else           &lt;rewrite other expressions&gt;)))</code></pre>



<p><em>Hint 1</em>: Consider how you can use <code>map</code> to convert <code>let</code> forms in every element of a list to the equivalent <code>lambda</code> form? Consider using <code>zip</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">scm&gt; (zip &#x27;((1 2) (3 4) (5 6)))
((1 3 5) (2 4 6))
scm&gt; (zip &#x27;((1 2)))
((1) (2))
scm&gt; (zip &#x27;())
(() ())</code></pre>



<p><em>Hint 2</em>: In this problem, it may be helpful to build a Scheme list that evaluates to a special form (for instance, a <code>lambda</code> expression). As a related example, the following code builds a scheme list that evaluates to the expression <code>(define (f x) (+ x 1))</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">(let ((name&#x2d;and&#x2d;params &#x27;(f x))
      (body &#x27;(+ x 1)))
  (cons &#x27;define
        (cons name&#x2d;and&#x2d;params (cons body nil))))</code></pre>



<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre style="margin-bottom:0;"><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q optional<button id="copy-code-python3ok-qoptional" class="inline-copy-button"><div class="copy-tooltip"><span>Copy</span></div>✂️</a></code></pre>
        <script>
        document.getElementById("copy-code-python3ok-qoptional").onclick = () => copyCode('python3 ok -q optional', "copy-code-python3ok-qoptional");
        </script>
        <br/>

<blockquote><p>We used let while defining <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code>. What if we want to run <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> on an interpreter that does not recognize <code>let</code>? We can pass <code>let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda</code> to itself to rewrite itself into an <em>equivalent program without</em> <code>let</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">;; The let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda procedure
(define (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda expr)
 ...)

;; A list representing the let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda procedure
(define let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda&#x2d;code
 &#x27;(define (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda expr)
    ...))

;; A let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda procedure that does not use &#x27;let&#x27;!
(define let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda&#x2d;without&#x2d;let
 (let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda let&#x2d;to&#x2d;lambda&#x2d;code))</code></pre></blockquote>
