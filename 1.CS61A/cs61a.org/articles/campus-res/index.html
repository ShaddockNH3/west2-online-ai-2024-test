      <h1>Department/Campus Resources</h1>
    </header>
     <p>In addition to receiving advice from course staff, there are many resources
available to students through the department and university. Often, finding and
accessing these resources can be overwhelming or challenging, but we hope to
provide you with an outline of resources available and somewhere to start.</p>

<p>This list is not complete and is subject to change and be updated. If you know
of a resource that is missing, feel free to email cs61a@berkeley.edu!</p>


<h2 id="reporting-an-incident">Reporting an Incident</h2>

<p>We recognize that disputes and conflicts can occur between students, staff,
instructors, etc. There are many different types of incidents, including but not
limited to discrimination, assault, conflict, etc., so we want to provide some
resources to help absolve any conflict you may face.</p>

<p>If you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, please feel free to make an appointment
with someone on staff (we are happy to point you in the right direction!)
through <a href="../../office-hours.html">advising</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The EECS department provides
  <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/grievances#eecs-climate">many ways</a>
  to report issues within the department, including general incidents,
  grievances with faculty, sexual harassment, and discrimination. Please report
  any incidents to us or to the department using the
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4NYHdUJ8IzYA1SoiTinWBybGWkj0mfmdnHAeygAxkZajelQ/viewform">department form</a>,
  so that we can continue to improve the CS student experience. Thank you!</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://advocate.berkeley.edu">Student Advocate’s Office</a> (SAO) "is a
  student-run organization that helps students litigate issues with professors."</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/Ombuds">Ombudsperson for Students</a> "can be your
  first step, your last resort, or anything in between. The Ombudsperson will
  listen to your concerns, serve as a sounding board, discuss your options with
  you, and help you get a new perspective and determine the next steps to take."</li>
  <li>Lastly, <a href="https://diversity.berkeley.edu/report-incident">many resources</a> of
  support and ways to report issues are provided by the university as well.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="advising">Advising</h2>

<p>Advising is meant as a resource to help guide you as a student through your
education and time at Berkeley. Some examples are to help with degree or
graduation requirements as well as campus policies and procedures. Outside of
61A where we have advising OH appointments, there are different types of
advising at Berkeley depending on your college.</p>

<blockquote><p>Still not sure where to start/go? <a href="../../office-hours.html">Come ask someone on staff!</a></p></blockquote>


<h3 id="college-of-letters-and-science">College of Letters and Science</h3>

<p>Within L&amp;S there are a few different types of advising: college, major, and peer
advising. College advisors take a broader view of your academics while major
advisors focus on your specific major.
<a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/appointments-advice/college-advising-vs-major-advising">This comprehensive guide</a>
explains their differences and how to access them.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://lsadvising.berkeley.edu/virtual-front-desk">virtual front desk</a>,
which is staffed by both staff and peer advisors, can also give more immediate
advice.</p>

<p>There is also peer advising which is based on the major/department you have
questions for! We highly recommend starting here as they have all the resources
from the school and department while also being able to understand your
experience from a potentially similar perspective. Here are a few listed, if you
don’t see one that is applicable to your situation, try searching in a browser
for “[department or college name] peer advising Berkeley”.</p>

provides a thorough overview of the services and different types of engineering
offered.</p>
